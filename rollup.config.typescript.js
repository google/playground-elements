/**
 * This Rollup config generates a JS module version of typescript from its
 * CommonJS version.
 *
 * It's generated separately from the main Rollup config because it is an input
 * to bundles generated there. We could also run this commonjs transform in the
 * main Rollup config, but having a genuine module in the sources makes a few
 * things easier:
 *
 * - We can import it into tests without also having to configure the commonjs
 *   transform there. @web/test-runner does support running the commonjs Rollup
 *   plugin, but for some reason it was still erroring.
 *
 * - The development loop generating the worker bundle is slightly faster,
 *   because we don't need to run the commonjs transform every time we build the
 *   worker.
 *
 * - We use module imports in the worker, for a faster development mode that
 *   doesn't bundle. Having only module sources makes this easier too.
